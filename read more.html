    <p data-reactid=".1dhxb6n2gow.5.1.0.0.1.0.0.1.1.$hed">With One Direction taking a break <em>Friends</em>-style and Taylor Swift <em>hinting</em> at one, it&rsquo;s imperative to find stellar replacements before next year begins. These artists are set to break out in 2016 in a major way. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a 5 Seconds of Summer replacement or a new take on country, these artists will make up your playlist all year long. Prepare for a Spotify playlist that will have all of your friends experiencing major FOMOYPP (fear of missing out on your perfect playlist). These groups make up the 2016 mix tape you need.</p>

    <p><strong><u>1.	Scott Helman</u></strong></p>
    <p><img src="images/download.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="97" align="left"/></p>
    <p>The ultra-adorable 20-year-old Scott Helman is a singer/songwriter you&rsquo;ll want to listen to on Spotify stat. His songs, like the sweet-as-sugar &ldquo;Bungalow,&rdquo; are so supremely catchy, you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve heard them before. They sound like a rom-com soundtrack come to life. He&rsquo;s opened for major artists including Tegan &amp; Sara and Shawn Mendes, but it&rsquo;s almost certain that bands will be opening for <em>him</em> in 2016.</p>

    <p><strong><u>2. The Front Bottoms<img src="images/download (1).jpg" alt="" width="153" height="138" align="right"/></u></strong></p>
    <p>For fans of pop punk bands like Say Anything and 5 Seconds of Summer, The Front Bottoms offer an honest take on relationships, growing up, and life (whether you&rsquo;re on tour or in college, since they&rsquo;ve had experiences with both). Their sound is more raw than that of most bands out right now — think shouted call-and-repeat choruses that turn live shows into sing-alongs a la Dashboard Confessional back in the day (only far less sad). Their combination of emo and indie make for a throwback to the early 2000s in the best possible way.</p>

    <p><strong><u>3. Shamir</u></strong></p>
    <p><img src="images/images.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="131" align="left"/> Shamir&rsquo;s colorful music videos and inventive personal style mean he&rsquo;s poised to be the next big thing. This self- identified queer artist grew up in the Las Vegas suburbs where he was heavily influenced by old school artists like Billie Holiday and Janis Joplin, as well as gospel music. Shamir makes dance music that&rsquo;s fun, playful, and doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously, and his bouncy beats will have you dancing, uninhibited and unafraid to be yourself — and it will make you understand why your parents loved disco.<br>

    <p><u><strong>4. Nikyee Heaton</strong></u><strong></strong><img src="images/niykee-heaton-hair-1-500x750.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="120" align="right"/></p>
    <p>Niykee became internet-famous for making sultry covers of your favourite hiphop songs. Her music is perfect for a girls&rsquo;-night-out because her songs all sound like they should be all over the radio. Imagine Halsey&rsquo;s dark lyrics with a Taylor Swift pop vibe, and Niykee Heaton appears on your playlist. Lyrics like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some damn bad intentions, I&rsquo;ve got some secrets I forgot to mention&rdquo; will have you ready to go out with your girls before you know it (with no boyfriends in tow).</p>

    <p><u><strong>5. Melanie Martinez</strong></u></p>
    <p><img src="images/download (2).jpg" alt="" width="88" height="104" align="left"/>This former <em>The Voice</em> star was most famous for her two-toned bangs and indie style — her Britney Spears cover was a breath of fresh air in a world of covers that sometimes sound like karaoke. Now she&rsquo;s better known for racking up millions of YouTube views with songs like &ldquo;Soap&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dollhouse&rdquo; — and the equal parts creepy and catchy &ldquo;Carousel&rdquo; opened up <em>American Horror Story: Freak Show.</em> To top it all off, her penchant for babydoll dresses and honest lyrics make her downright Tumblr-worthy.<br>
