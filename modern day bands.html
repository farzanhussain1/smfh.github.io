          <p>The Dublin duo of Lar Kaye and Conor Adams already have a wealth of experience between them. Kaye was a member of the trio Adebisi Shank, while Adams was an occasional member of The Cast Of Cheers. Their love of glorious pop showed on their fantastic single Darkest Ocean and they attracted some attention by covering Justin Bieber&rsquo;s hit as WHERE R U NOVV. Their debut album IIVV drops in August, with a headline tour of the UK due in October.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Originally from Surrey, now based in Soho, Harriet Starling calls herself &ldquo;a real girl in an unreal world&rdquo; and her songs deal with &ldquo;depression, solitude and the darker sides of the human conditions.&rdquo; Sprinkling her songs with some light synths and the odd electronic beat makes clear her declared influences: Massive Attack, Portishead, Florence and the Machine and more. She plays two London showcases in October. </p>

            <p>Sundara means &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; in Sanskrit, and this quartet live up to their blissful name with some epic and anthemic indie rock, gaining comparisons from Arcade Fire to Bruce Springsteen.

            </p>
            
            <p>Just 22 years old, singer-songwriter Lawrence Taylor has a raw, bluesy sound that immediately attracted A&amp;R men across the nation. Compared to artists as diverse as James Bay, Hozier and George Ezra, Taylor&rsquo;s music is simple, honest and emotional, with a classic rock guitar backing. A summer of touring the US will see Lawrence return to the UK in the autumn with a support slot for Birdy.</p>

            <h2>20. VIOLA BEACH</h2>
            <div>
              <p><img title="" src="http://assets1.radiox.co.uk/2015/52/viola-beach-2015-1451245879-homepage-promo-0.jpeg" alt="Viola Beach 2015" width="500" height="160"></p>
            </div>
            <p>When we first published this feature back in January 2016, this young band from Warrington were set for great things. They&rsquo;d released a well-received single, Swings And Waterslides and the band were heading out on a tour of the UK, which included a hometown show in March.</p>
            <p>All of this potential was abruptly ended when the entire band - Kris Leonard (guitar, vocals), River Reeves (guitar), Tomas Lowe (bass) and Jack Dakin (drums) - died in a car accident alongside their manager Craig Tarry on 13 February 2016, while travelling back from their first European festival appearance in Sweden.</p>
            <p>It was a horribly tragic end to a promising new band at the beginning of their career. Radio X had supported Viola Beach from the beginning and had tipped them for great things - tragically they were not around to see their self-titled debut album reach Number 1 in the UK charts. Such a shame. RIP.</p>
